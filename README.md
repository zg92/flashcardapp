# Flask Flash Card App

Purpose:

Interactive app that allows users to create custom flash card sets for studying.

How to Use:

Upon starting, the default state/capitol set will be loaded. If you would like to upload a custom csv, simply click upload and enter a title and csv in the provided form and then submit. I recommend creating a set via Excel or Sheets and copy and pasting the csv from there. 

Troubleshooting:

If your set does not appear correct based on what was entered in the upload, ensure there were no commas with in the columns you tried to upload (commas will confuse the csv upload). 

Design:

This app was designed to using a Flask/Python back end with a HTML/CSS/JS front end.
